# Advanced CSS Portfolio Homework Assignment

## What I attempted to do:

Create a portfolio that I can add to and improve that will eventually be used to share with potential employers. I included information about myself, my work so far, and contact information. I will continue to enhance these sections as I complete more projects and can add more details about my coding skills.
